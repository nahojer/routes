# routes

Package `routes` provides a fast routing mechanism of HTTP requests to route values. Serves as a building block for
writing HTTP router packaes. Check out [httprouter](https://github.com/nahojer/httprouter) for an example of how this 
package might be used.

All of the documentation can be found on the [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nahojer/sage?tab=doc) website.
